안녕하세요. 데이터 분석가를 꿈꾸는 star6973이라 합니다. 전공은 컴퓨터공학부를 수료하였고, 원래는 백엔드 개발자가 되려고 했었지만 빅데이터에 관심이 생기고 나서부터 데이터 분석가가 되려고 합니다. 이 직무에 관심이 생기고 나서 우연한 기회로 인턴을 하게 되었습니다. 인턴 기간 중 생각보다 비전공자들이 이 분야에 많이 있다는 것을 알았으며, 그들의 실력이 정말 훌륭하다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 너무 늦게 시작한건 아닌지 두려운 마음도 있지만, 학부 생활동안 배웠던 개발 능력과 더불어 빠르게 데이터분석 실력도 높여 [풀스택 개발자 + 데이터 분석가]로서 성장하고 싶습니다. 그동안 깃허브로 프로젝트를 관리해왔으나, 앞으로는 깃허브 블로그도 만들어서 데이터 분석쪽에 초점을 맞추어 포스팅을 해보고자 합니다. 제가 생각하는 방향과 공부한 내용들이 미숙할 수 있기에, 많은 피드백 부탁드립니다. 

감사합니다.

Hello. My nickname is star6973, who dreaming to be a data analyst. I majored in Computer Science and originally intended to be a backend developer, but after I became interested in big data, I wanted to become a data analyst. After I got interested in this job, I had an internship by chance. During my internship, I knew there were more non-majors in this field than I thought, and I realized that their skills were really good. I'm afraid that it started too late, but I want to grow as a [Full Stack Developer + Data Analyst] by improving my data analysis skills and based on the development skills I have learned during my undergraduate years. I have been managing the project with GitHub, but now I will create a GitHub blog and focus on data analysis. Please give me a lot of feedback because I think my thoughts and study may be immature.

Thank you.

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). I have used Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share. But, the content and opnion that you see here are personal and not related to companies / clients i work with. And regarding the code you see there.. you may use it as per your discretion.

## About this Theme

Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn't find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.

You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.
